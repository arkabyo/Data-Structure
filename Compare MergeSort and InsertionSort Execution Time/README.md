This is a project required for CSE Algorithm Class where I have to compare 2 sorting algorithms' execution time. I am using C++ to write the algorithms.

Comparing MErgerSort and InsertionSort execution time using C++. Execution time is recorded using system clock and random numbers to fill the array to sort. The output is saved in a CSV file.`
